  <!-- Introduction to AI -->
  <section id="intro">
    <h2>What is AI?</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using it), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. AI encompasses a broad range of technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision.</p>
    <h2> Components of AI:</h2>
    <p>Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms can improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.

      Deep Learning: A specialized form of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to analyze various factors of data. Deep learning is particularly effective for tasks such as image and speech recognition.
      
      Natural Language Processing (NLP): This area of AI focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a valuable way.
      
      Computer Vision: This technology allows computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, enabling applications like facial recognition, image analysis, and object detection.
      
      Robotics: AI is applied in robotics to create machines capable of carrying out tasks autonomously, enhancing efficiency in various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics.</p>
      <h2>Applications of AI:</h2>
      <p>AI is transforming numerous fields, including healthcare (predictive analytics, diagnostics), finance (fraud detection, algorithmic trading), transportation (self-driving cars), customer service (chatbots), and entertainment (recommendation systems). As AI technologies continue to evolve, they hold the potential to reshape the future of work and society, enabling smarter decision-making and driving innovation across various sectors.</p>
